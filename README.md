# BANK-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
A **Bank Management System** project using **Java NetBeans** and **DBMS** involves developing a comprehensive software application for managing banking operations effectively. This project typically provides functionalities like account management (creating, updating, and deleting accounts), transaction handling (deposits, withdrawals, and transfers), balance inquiries, loan management, and generating account statements. Java serves as the core programming language, leveraging its robust features for building the front-end and business logic. NetBeans, an integrated development environment (IDE), simplifies the development process with features like code editing, debugging, and GUI creation. The database management system (DBMS) is used to store and retrieve critical data, ensuring security and scalability. Popular choices for the DBMS include MySQL or Oracle, which integrate seamlessly with Java through JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). This project is ideal for learning practical applications of Java and DBMS while developing skills in software design, database connectivity, and user interface creation.
